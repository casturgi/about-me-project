  <h1>Introduction
    </h1>
  <p>Most recently I am an aspiring front end and iOS developer. But in the past two years, I've been many things. A bartender, an English teacher, a studio musician, an audio engineer, a projectionist, and a wandering traveler to name a few. </p>
  <p>The internet has been instrumental in jumpstarting every major chapter of my life and its dynamic ability to connect people in distant places has sparked my interest in learning about and working with coding. </p>

  <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
  <p>Im from Asheville, NC and if you haven't been there you should make plans to visit. Arguably the best craft beer culture in the USA, a vibrant music scene, and all set in the Great Smokey Mountains. My home town is known for it's strong dedication to craft and design, a quality that I bring to the table in spades.

  <h1>More About Me</h1>
		<h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
					<p>I love to play the guitar. It seems like I never have enough time to play. 
					</p>
				<h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
					<p>I have been trying to figure that out for years. I know that it will be one that allows for me to be location independent, creative, and is relavant to my interests in music and travel. 
					</p>
				<h2>What's your background?</h2>
					<p>I've done some independent study over the last year. I completed the codeacademy section about Html and Css but I didn't use it much after I finished it so I'm seeking a better working knowledge of it as well as advice on how to find freelance work. 
					</p>
				<h2>What have you been listening to lately?</h2>
					<p> I have been listening to Tame Impala on repeat the last couple of days as well as Parov Stelar and other jazz-influenced dance music.
